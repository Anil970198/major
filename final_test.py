            You are writing a short, realistic email for testing an AI assistant.

Guidelines:
- The email must clearly reflect the **{subtype}** category.
- Write exactly 2 paragraphs â€” no longer than 5â€“7 total lines.
- Do NOT include irrelevant details or mention labels like "this is a quote".
- The tone should be professional or neutral.
- If this is a DEADLINE_TASK, include a real due date like "June 8th, 5PM IST".
- The email should feel natural and plausible but short enough to summarize.

Only write the email content. Do NOT include a subject line or greeting unless it makes sense.

Context:
{description}
